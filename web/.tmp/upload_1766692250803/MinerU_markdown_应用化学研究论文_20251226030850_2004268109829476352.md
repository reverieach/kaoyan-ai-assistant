decreased compared to standard conditions.Additionally, different types of ester groups yielded the desired cycloadducts with good yields (4b-4d).Even more interesting is that BCB containing a terminal alkene moiety was still welltolerated in this reaction (4b). This suggests that the reaction can efficiently distinguish between different types of double bonds (according to the proposed mechanism in

Figure 5F). Next, except for the para-iodo-substituted giving $32 \%$ yield (4i),BCB with phenyls bearing para- or metasubstitutedelectron-withdrawingorelectron-donating groups，as well as disubstituted phenyls,all served as suitable substrates,providing the corresponding products in good yields (4e-4h, 4j-4o). This indicates a broader range of functional group compatibility than 1,3-cyclization reac
